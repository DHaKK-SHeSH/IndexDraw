### Index Draw
This project allows the user to draw on the presented slides by first converting the PowerPoint presentation to images(implemented) and then using mediapipe as a laser pointer(to be implemented).

#### Ideas
1) Using python to manipulate the ppt ☑️
  - Change the PPT to images for presentation ✔️
2) Using hands as mouse pointer (change slides, annotate slides using index)
3) Vanishing lines
